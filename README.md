cluster-fudge
=============

A helpful repository of sample configuration files and sample code snippets for my talk at WordCamp Austin 2014, "Cluster Fudge: Recipes for WordPress in the Cloud".  I'll continue to build on this with more sample code and configuration files.  Feel free to make suggestions!

## Share this repo with your friends!
Give them the [http://bit.ly/cluster-fudge](http://bit.ly/cluster-fudge) URL so they can get their learn on, too.
