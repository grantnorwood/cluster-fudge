Cluster Fudge: <br/>Recipes for WordPress in the Cloud
=================================================

A helpful repository of sample configuration files and sample code snippets for my talk at **WordCamp Austin 2014**, [_"Cluster Fudge: Recipes for WordPress in the Cloud"_](http://2014.austin.wordcamp.org/session/cluster-fudge-recipes-for-wordpress-in-the-cloud/).  I'll continue to build on this with more sample code and configuration files.

> Your self-hosted WordPress site is quickly growing in popularity and page views. Or maybe you want to get away from that costly enterprise CMS currently on your plate and adopt a delectable, open-source platform. There are many reasons you might need the performance and redundancy of a clustered server solution, and I’ll show you how to mix up the ingredients needed to throw together a successful cloud-hosted WordPress environment that’s right for you. <br/><br/>We’ll talk about common multi-server configurations, from cheap and quick for the cost-conscious business, to robust and complex for the high level of control an enterprise demands. <br/><br/>You will leave with a better knowledge of which web server makes sense for your requirements, and learn some tips and tricks to better caching without sacrificing the dynamic nature of WordPress. Downloadable code snippets and example config files will help get you started in your own cloud environment.
